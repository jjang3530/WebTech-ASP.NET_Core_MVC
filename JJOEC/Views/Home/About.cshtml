<h2>@ViewData["Title"].</h2>

<h3>This is @@ViewData["message"] just dumped on the page:</h3>
<p> @ViewData["Message"]</p>
<h3>This is ViewData["message"] dumped without the "@@":</h3>
<p> ViewData["Message"]</p>
<h3>This is ViewData["message"] in a command to turn off html-encode:</h3>
<p>@Html.Raw(ViewData["Message"])</p>

<p>
    Using "@@" causes the Razor engine to shift to code view.  If the word immediately after
    "@@" is a C# command, it'll execute it.  If not, it'll assume it to be a variable and
    return its value to the page.

<p>
    Razor HTML-encodes variable data so "nasties" don't put &lt;script&gt; on your database
    to send to other users.
